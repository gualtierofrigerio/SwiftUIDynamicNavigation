# SwiftUIDynamicNavigation

Sample project to play with the concept of Coordinator in SwiftUI

The idea is having a Coordinator (or multiple ones) take care of the view hierarchy by providing the correct view for each state the app is currenly on. Pushing and popping views should be taken care by the coordinator, so a SwiftUI view doesn't need to know what is the next view in the hiearchy. 


Still working in progress
